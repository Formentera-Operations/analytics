# Peloton WellView Data Model - Schema Index
# Source: Peloton WellView -> Fivetran -> Snowflake (PELOTON_FORMENTERAOPS_FORMENTERAOPS_WV120)
# Snowflake naming: WVT_WV<ENTITYNAME> (e.g. WVT_WVWELLHEADER, WVT_WVJOB)
# Schemas: FORMENTERAOPS_WV120_CALC (most tables), FORMENTERAOPS_WV120_DBO (system integrations only)
#
# Load only the domain file(s) needed for your current task.
# Common fields omitted from all files (on every table):
#   System: IDWELL sysLock* sysMod* sysCreate* sysTag
#   Record: IDRec IDRecParent *TK columns
#
# Calc tables are included in their respective domain files, marked with # CALC TABLE tag.
# Extension tables are marked with +extension (share IDRec with parent).
