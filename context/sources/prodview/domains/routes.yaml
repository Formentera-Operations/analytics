# Relationships:
#   This domain contains TWO independent sub-hierarchies. Do not conflate them.
#
#   Sub-hierarchy 1: pvRouteSet chain (independent root — NOT a pvUnit child)
#   pvRouteSet is the root entity representing a series of field routes defined at a date.
#   pvRouteSet 1:many -> pvRouteSetRoute (via routeset.idrec = route.idrecparent)
#   pvRouteSetRoute 1:many -> pvRouteSetRouteUnit (via route.idrec = routeunit.idrecparent)
#   pvRouteSetRouteUnit -> pvUnit (cross-reference: IDRecUnit identifies the unit visited at this stop)
#   pvRouteSetRoute 1:many -> pvRouteSetRouteVwFlowDiag (via route.idrec = vwflowdiag.idrecparent)
#   pvRouteSetRoute 1:many -> pvRouteSetRouteDtListCalc (via route.idrec = dtlistcalc.idrecparent; calc)
#   pvRouteSetRoute 1:many -> pvRouteSetRouteUserID (via route.idrec = userid.idrecparent)
#
#   Sub-hierarchy 2: pvUnit calc children (standard pvUnit child pattern)
#   These tables are pvUnit children placed in this domain because they support route entry security.
#   pvUnit 1:many -> pvUnitUserIDCalc (via unit.idrec = calcuserid.idrecparent AND idflownet; calc)
#   pvUnit 1:many -> pvUnitDateListCalc (via unit.idrec = datelist.idrecparent AND idflownet; calc)
#
# Key patterns:
#   - pvRouteSet is NOT a pvUnit child — it is an independent field operations entity. Do not
#     attempt to join pvRouteSet to pvUnit via idrecparent.
#   - pvRouteSetRouteUnit is a cross-reference back to pvUnit: IDRecUnit (FK) identifies which
#     unit/completion is the stop on a given route. This is the bridge between the route hierarchy
#     and the well/completion hierarchy.
#   - pvUnitUserIDCalc and pvUnitDateListCalc are calc tables — read-only, system-generated.
#     Use for route-based entry security lookups only; not raw measurements.
#   - pvRouteSetRouteDtListCalc is also a calc table — represents visible entry dates per route.
#   - Low mart relevance: this domain is primarily field operations scheduling data. It does not
#     contain production volumes, tests, or financial data.
#   - idflownet: applies to pvUnit child joins (pvUnitUserIDCalc, pvUnitDateListCalc); the
#     pvRouteSet chain does not consistently use idflownet scoping.
