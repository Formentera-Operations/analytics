# Relationships:
#   Group 1: pvUnit children (standard idrecparent/idflownet join)
#   pvUnit 1:many -> pvUnitAgreemt (partnership agreements, via unit.idrec = agreemt.idrecparent AND unit.idflownet = agreemt.idflownet)
#   pvUnitAgreemt 1:many -> pvUnitAgreemtPartner (partner details per agreement, via agreemt.idrec = partner.idrecparent AND agreemt.idflownet = partner.idflownet)
#
#   Group 2: Standalone workflow/partner entities (NO pvUnit parent — idrecparent/idflownet join pattern does NOT apply)
#   pvApproval 1:many -> pvApprovalStep (via approval.idrec = step.idrecparent)
#   pvApprovalStep 1:many -> pvApprovalStepDeliv (deliverables, via step.idrec = deliv.idrecparent)
#   pvApprovalStep 1:many -> pvApprovalStepPreReq (prerequisites, via step.idrec = prereq.idrecparent)
#   pvApprovalStep 1:many -> pvApprovalStepRev (approvers required, via step.idrec = rev.idrecparent)
#   pvApprovalStepRev 1:many -> pvApprovalStepRevAction (action required per approver, via rev.idrec = action.idrecparent)
#   pvTask 1:many -> pvTaskDetail (task details, via task.idrec = detail.idrecparent)
#   pvRespTeam 1:many -> pvRespTeamMember (team members, via team.idrec = member.idrecparent)
#   pvPartner 1:many -> pvPartnerContact (partner contact records, via partner.idrec = contact.idrecparent)
#
# Key patterns:
#   - idrec/idrecparent/idflownet compound join applies to Group 1 tables (pvUnitAgreemt, pvUnitAgreemtPartner) only — these are scoped to the flow network
#   - Group 2 tables (pvApproval, pvTask, pvRespTeam, pvPartner and their children) are standalone entities — their joins do NOT use idflownet scope
#   - pvPartner/pvPartnerContact represent a global partner directory with no pvUnit context — they are not anchored to any flow network node
#   - Approval workflow is 4 levels deep: pvApproval -> pvApprovalStep ->
#     {pvApprovalStepDeliv | pvApprovalStepPreReq | pvApprovalStepRev} -> pvApprovalStepRevAction
#   - Staging models: stg_prodview__agreement_partners, stg_prodview__partnership_agreements,
#     stg_prodview__regulatory_reporting_keys, stg_prodview__remarks, stg_prodview__tickets
