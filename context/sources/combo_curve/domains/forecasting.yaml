# ComboCurve: Forecasting
# Forecast definitions, decline curve outputs, daily forecast volumes
#
# Types: txt=string float=float int=integer ts=timestamp_ntz bool=boolean variant=variant(JSON)
#
# OMITTED (on most tables): PROJECTCUSTOMHEADER9 (Portable connector artifact)
#
# Staged: stg_cc__forecasts, stg_cc__forecast_outputs, stg_cc__daily_forecasts
#
# Relationships:
#   PROJECTS 1:many -> FORECASTS (via PROJECT)
#   FORECASTS 1:many -> FORECAST_OUTPUTS (via FORECAST + PROJECT)
#   FORECASTS 1:many -> FORECASTED_DAILY_VOLUMES_BY_PROJECT (via FORECAST + PROJECT)
#   FORECAST_OUTPUTS grain: one row per well per phase per forecast
#   FORECASTED_DAILY_VOLUMES_BY_PROJECT grain: one row per well per forecast (phases nested in VARIANT)
#
# Key patterns:
#   - FORECAST_OUTPUTS contains decline curve parameters in VARIANT columns (BEST, RATIO, TYPECURVEDATA)
#   - FORECASTED_DAILY_VOLUMES_BY_PROJECT.PHASES requires FLATTEN to extract daily values by phase
#   - Forecast types: auto, manual, typeCurve
#   - Phases: oil, gas, water


# Tables in this domain (column details in tables/ directory):
#   FORECASTS: Forecast run definitions. Name, type, project, run date, tags.
#   FORECAST_OUTPUTS: Decline curve parameters per well per phase. Contains VARIANT columns for curve segments.
#   FORECASTED_DAILY_VOLUMES_BY_PROJECT: Daily forecast volumes with nested phase data in VARIANT column.
