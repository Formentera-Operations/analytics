ODA_BATCH_ODA_WELL: Well master records. Each row is a well (or property/unit) in the ODA system. Contains well identification (API number), geographic location, operating group, production status, and billing/revenue hold flags. Core reference table — most transactional tables reference a well.

  # -- Identifiers --
  ID(txt) #Primary key (GUID)
  WELLIDENTITY(int) #Numeric identity for the well
  NID(int) #Numeric identifier
  CODE(txt) #Well code (user-facing identifier). right(CODE, 6) = EID — legacy derivation path used in int_well__oda. Prefer PROPERTYREFERENCECODE for direct EID matching.
  CODESORT(txt) #Sortable version of the code
  NAME(txt) #Well name
  APINUMBER(txt) #API well number (state-assigned unique well identifier)
  PROPERTYREFERENCECODE(txt) #Well classification code (OPERATED, NON-OPERATED, ACCOUNTING, CONTRACT_OP, etc.). Used as op/non-op classifier in int_well__oda. NOT the EID — despite the field name suggesting a cross-reference.
