# Staged: stg_oda__afe_v2, stg_oda__afebudget, stg_oda__afebudgetdetail_v2,

# Relationships:
#   ODA_BATCH_ODA_AFE_V2 1:many -> ODA_AFEBUDGET (via ID -> AFEID)
#   ODA_AFEBUDGET 1:many -> ODA_AFEBUDGETDETAIL_V2 (via ID -> AFEBUDGETID)
#   ODA_BATCH_ODA_AFE_V2 many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_ENTITY_V2 (via ENTITYID, in master_data domain)
#   ODA_BATCH_ODA_AFE_V2 many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_COMPANY_V2 (via COMPANYID, in master_data domain)
#   ODA_AFEBUDGETDETAIL_V2 many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_ACCOUNT_V2 (via ACCOUNTID, in master_data domain)
#
# Key patterns:
#   - All 4 tables are batch (no CDC, no delete filtering needed)
#   - AFE (Authorization for Expenditure) is the budgeting mechanism for capital spending in oil & gas
#   - AFE_V2 is the header (2.2K AFEs, 46 cols) — contains approval status, total amounts, entity/company assignment
#   - AFEBUDGET groups budget line items by category within an AFE (1.9K budgets)
#   - AFEBUDGETDETAIL_V2 is the line-item detail (424K rows) — account-coded budget amounts
#   - REVENUESUSPENSECATEGORY (24 rows) is a lookup table for categorizing suspended revenue
#   - Revenue suspense tracks revenue that cannot yet be distributed (title issues, missing division orders, etc.)
#   - Downstream: bridge_job_afe in the drilling mart links WellView jobs to AFEs
