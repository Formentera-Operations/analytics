# ODA: Supporting
# JIB (Joint Interest Billing), check revenue, calendar, user fields, revision states, and source modules
#
# Types: txt=string num=number(38,6) int=integer ts=timestamp_ntz bool=boolean
#
# Staged: stg_oda__jib, stg_oda__jibdetail, stg_oda__checkrevenue, stg_oda__calendar,
#         stg_oda__userfield, stg_oda__revision_state, stg_oda__source_module
#
# Relationships:
#   ODA_JIB 1:many -> ODA_JIBDETAIL (via ID -> JIBID)
#   ODA_JIB many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_ENTITY_V2 (via ENTITYID, in master_data domain)
#   ODA_JIB many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_VENDOR_V2 (via VENDORID, in master_data domain)
#   ODA_JIBDETAIL many:1 -> ODA_BATCH_ODA_ACCOUNT_V2 (via ACCOUNTID, in master_data domain)
#   ODA_CHECKREVENUE many:1 -> ODA_APCHECK (via APCHECKID, in accounts_payable domain)
#
# Key patterns:
#   - ODA_JIB and ODA_JIBDETAIL are CDC (63M rows each — require _operation_type != 'd' filtering)
#   - JIB (Joint Interest Billing) tracks cost-sharing between working interest owners on a well
#   - JIB header has the billing period, entity, vendor; JIBDetail has account-coded line items
#   - ODA_CHECKREVENUE (659K rows) is from an old/orphaned Estuary connector — data may be stale
#   - MDM_CALENDAR (37K rows) is a shared MDM reference table with fiscal/calendar date dimensions
#   - ODA_USERFIELD (4.8M rows) is a generic key-value table for custom fields across ODA entities
#   - ODA_REVISIONSTATE (3 rows) is a tiny lookup for revision lifecycle states (draft, approved, etc.)
#   - ODA_BATCH_ODA_SOURCEMODULE (26 rows) is a lookup for ODA module identifiers
#   - Downstream: int_oda_calendar provides fiscal period lookups; userfield is joined for custom metadata
