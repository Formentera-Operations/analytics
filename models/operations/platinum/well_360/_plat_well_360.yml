  - name: plat_well__performance_scorecard
    description: >
      Platinum OBT (one big table) at the EID grain providing a complete lifetime
      performance scorecard for every known well. Spines from well_360 including
      pre-production and inactive wells. LEFT JOINs aggregate production,
      financials, drilling, and completion data. Intended for BI consumption —
      no joins required at query time.

      Grain: one row per EID (well). Includes all wells in well_360, with NULL
      aggregates for wells with no activity in a given business process.

      DATA FRESHNESS: Drilling EID resolution follows well_360 → fct_drilling_time
      / fct_daily_drilling_cost → int_well_perf__drilling_summary → this model.
      Build well_360 before drilling facts in daily batch to ensure EID consistency.

      UNRESOLVED WELLS: ~18.5% of fct_well_production_monthly unit-months have no
      well_360 match (is_eid_unresolved = true). These are excluded from production
      aggregates. They appear in the spine with NULL production metrics.

          Audit column: sum of stimulated interval length from fct_stimulation across all stim jobs.
          Do NOT use as intensity denominator — use well_lateral_length_ft instead.
          For re-stimulated wells, this sum can overstate the perforated interval.

        description: >

          not the stimulated interval, to correctly handle re-stimulated wells.
