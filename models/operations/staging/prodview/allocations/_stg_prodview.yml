    description: >
      ProdView daily allocation calculations — allocated production volumes per completion
      per day. This is the most-queried ProdView table and the foundation for all production
      reporting. Includes gathered/allocated/new-production volumes, WI/NRI percentages,
      disposition breakdowns, inventory, cumulative production, heat content, and density.
      One row per completion per day. Source: PVT_PVUNITALLOCMONTHDAY.
